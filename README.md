# Job-Application-Matcher
Job Application Matcher is a powerful system that automates the process of screening resumes and matching candidates to job openings using AI, ML, and NLP. The system parses resumes, extracts key information, and matches candidates with suitable job roles based on their skills, experience, and job requirements. This project uses a MySQL database to store candidate data and job listings, along with a backend built in Python and Java for smooth integration.

This project aims to optimize the hiring process by reducing time and ensuring fairness, making it an essential tool for HR teams in companies.
